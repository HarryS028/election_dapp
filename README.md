### Election DApp

**Summary**: A basic decentralised voting application built on Ethereum for adding candidates and recording votes.

**Functionality**: The DApp was built using Solidity to build a basic smart contract, and interacts with the blockchain via the web.js library. The contract was not actually deployed to the Ethereum blockchain, and instead Truffle and Ganache were used for development, testing, and deployment to a local blockchain instance. The front end is served to the user with some basic HTML and CSS.
